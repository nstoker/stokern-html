# README

This is a Go powered version of the Ruby-on-Rails site previously here. The switch from Rails was due to the
short-sighted decision of the original host to remove the free layer of database.

It's still just a single page app.

Largely based on the examples in the [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla) repo.
